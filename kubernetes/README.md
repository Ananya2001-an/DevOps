## Need of Kubernetes

It’s a **container orchestration tool**. Rise of monolith to microservices architecture led to rise in usage of containers but maintaining those thousands of containers was not easy so we wanted an orchestration tool like Kubernetes. It has 3 advantages➖

1. High availability and downtime
2. Scaling and high performance
3. Disaster recovery - backup and restore
