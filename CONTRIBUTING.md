# Welcome to "DevOps" contribution guide

I am happy that you have decided to contribute to this repository. ðŸ’– 

Kindly follow the below steps for contributing:-

1. Raise an issue before creating a PR. Once issue gets approved, only then you should start working on resolving it.
2. How to make changes?
   - Fork and clone the repo
   
   - You must have **Git** installed on your PC.
   
   - You can now run the app by 2 ways: use `VS Code Live server` extension on the index.html file or run this command in terminal `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` which will build the app's image and run it on port 8000. If you choose the second option then make sure you have both `docker` and `docker compose V2` installed on your PC.
   
   - Make changes with your favorite IDE and see them getting implemented on the live running site. (You may have to refresh the page)
   
   - Now commit and push the changes to your fork and later raise a PR to this repo. If everything works out fine, your PR will get merged!ðŸ˜€
